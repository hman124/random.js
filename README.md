# Random.js

A random string generator with letters and numbers

## Adding it

Simply add this `<script>` tag to the bottom of the `<body>` tag:

`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hman124/random.js/random.min.js"></script>`

## Using it

To generate a rendom string, use the `generateStr()` function with a length parameter specifying how long you want the string to be. Example: `generateStr(5)` will return `XXXXX`.

## Contributions, Forks, Etc

This code isn't really made for anything fancy, it is just a fun experiment. And while it isn't really a big project, if you would like to change the code yourself, feel free to do so. While I probably won't be accepting any contributions to *this* repository, feel free to make a fork and experiment yourself!
